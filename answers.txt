int printf(const char *format, ...);

int fprintf(FILE *stream, const char *format, ...);

fprintf() takes an extra first argument: a pointer to a FILE stream (such as stdout, stderr, or a file).
printf() always prints to standard output.

printf() prints to standard output.
fprintf() prints to the specified output stream.
So fprintf() is more general because it can write to files, sockets, or the terminal.

Hello, world from fprintf!

int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
    const char msg[] = "Hello, world from write!\n";
    write(STDOUT_FILENO, msg, 26);
    return 0;
}

If you change:
write(STDOUT_FILENO, msg, 1000);
The program prints the real message and other wasteful characters.
This happens because write() keeps reading memory past the end of the string than printing whatever bytes exist there.
This is undefined behavior and can crash the program.
11.
Use C library functions when:
You want portability (works on Windows, macOS, Linux).
You want safer, higher-level tools (like fprintf, fopen, malloc).
Use system calls when:
You need OS-level control.
You want maximum performance or direct hardware/OS interaction.
You are writing kernels, shells, or low-level tools.
